Proxy Pattern – Image Management System
 
In this case, we use the Proxy Pattern to load high-resolution images only when necessary and protect the upload functionality with a proxy that checks for authentication.

What problem was solved?

The Proxy Pattern solves the problem of loading high-resolution images in a system without consuming too much memory or bandwidth.
